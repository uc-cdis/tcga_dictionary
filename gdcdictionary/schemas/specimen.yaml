description: Any material sample taken from a biological entity for testing, diagnostic,
  propagation, treatment or research purposes, including a sample obtained from a
  living organism or taken from the biological object after halting of all its life
  functions. Biospecimen can contain one or more components including but not limited
  to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory
  products. In the case of contrived samples, it describes any material obtained from
  a normal donor.
